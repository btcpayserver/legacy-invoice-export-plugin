## Motivation

This plugin enables access to the `Legacy Invoice Report` from the `Reporting` page in BTCPay Server.

Until version 2.1.6, the `Legacy Invoice Report` was part of the core. Starting with version 2.1.7, the report was replaced by the updated `Invoice Report`, which includes additional columns and some renamed fields.

While we recommend using the new `Invoice Report`, this plugin is provided to maintain compatibility with existing workflows that rely on the legacy version.
